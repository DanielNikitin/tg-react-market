Hi!

This is web-app marketplace for Telegram.
Based on React JS, and payment system what i used is stripe.com
If you want to try demo, you can use my bot in telegram @dcg_js_test_bot.

Node invoice handler need to track and send an estimated invoice, which, after payment, 
will send purchased items by email(for example) in order to understand what exactly the client bought.
I didn't find any documentation on stripe.com to be able to track this using any function.

Regards,
Daniel
