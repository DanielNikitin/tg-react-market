This is web-app marketplace for Telegram. <br>
Based on React JS, and payment system is Stripe.com <br>
<br>
NodeJS invoice handler need to track and send an estimated invoice, which, after payment, <br>
will send purchased items by email(for example) in order to understand what exactly the client bought. <br>
I didn't find any documentation on stripe.com to be able to track this using any function. <br>
